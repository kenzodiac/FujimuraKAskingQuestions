Everything worked I liked how I was able to put a very specific time like AM or PM. The code looked clean and was able to understand it the only critique I have for it is that I am able to type in anything for the time I woke up I think it would of been good if there was validation for it so that they are only able to type a number for the time also was when I push enter it also leaves the answers blank, other then that everything else looked good.
